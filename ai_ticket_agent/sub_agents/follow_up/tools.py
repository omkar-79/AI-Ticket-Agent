---
Ticket ID: {ticket_id}
Ticket Subject: {ticket.subject}
Assigned Team: {ticket.assigned_team}
Resolution Notes: {ticket.resolution_notes}
User Feedback: {user_feedback}
---

Based on this feedback, should the ticket be closed (user is satisfied) or reopened (user is not satisfied)?
Consider the following:
- If the user expresses satisfaction, gratitude, or confirms the solution worked, respond with 'close'
- If the user expresses dissatisfaction, mentions issues, or requests further assistance, respond with 'reopen'
- If the feedback is ambiguous, default to 'reopen' to ensure user satisfaction

Respond with only one word: 'close' or 'reopen'.
